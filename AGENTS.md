# AGENTS

Guidance for contributors editing this store repository.

## Required Structure

- All installable content lives under `store/`.
- Supported categories:
  - `store/agents/*.md`
  - `store/commands/*.md`
  - `store/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  - `store/providers/*.json`
  - `store/mcps/*.json`

## Conventions

- Keep IDs stable. Renaming files/folders changes item identity.
- Prefer additive changes; avoid replacing existing IDs unless intentionally overriding behavior.
- Skills should keep `name` in frontmatter aligned with directory name.
- Providers/MCPs must include `_meta.description`; `_meta.tags` is optional.

## Metadata Support

### Identity and merge behavior

Item identity is based on `(type, id)` and source priority determines winners on collisions.

- `type` comes from folder category (`agents`, `commands`, `skills`, `providers`, `mcps`).
- `id` comes from filename/folder naming conventions.
- Frontmatter does not override identity.

### Behavior-driving metadata

These fields currently affect `skillful` logic directly.

#### Agent (`store/agents/<id>.md`)

- `description` (`string`, optional): used for display text fallback.
- `targets` (`string | string[]`, optional): target allow-list. If present, item is shown only for listed targets.

#### Command (`store/commands/<id>.md`)

- `description` (`string`, optional): used for display text fallback.
- `targets` (`string | string[]`, optional): target allow-list. If present, item is shown only for listed targets.

#### Skill (`store/skills/<folder>/SKILL.md`)

- `name` (`string`, required): if missing, skill is skipped.
- `description` (`string`, required): if missing, skill is skipped.
- `targets` (`string | string[]`, optional): target allow-list. If present, item is shown only for listed targets.

#### Provider (`store/providers/<id>.json`)

- `_meta.description` (`string`, required): if missing, provider is skipped.

#### MCP (`store/mcps/<id>.json`)

- `_meta.description` (`string`, required): if missing, MCP item is skipped.

### Target allow-list (`targets`)

When `targets` is omitted, the item is visible for all targets.

Supported target IDs:

- `opencode`
- `claude-code`
- `codex-cli`
- `codex-app`

Accepted formats:

```yaml
targets: opencode
```

```yaml
targets: [opencode, codex-cli]
```

Invalid/unknown target values are ignored. If no valid values remain, the item is treated as unscoped (visible to all targets).

### Indexed-for-tags metadata (not logic-driving)

These fields are currently converted into tags for browsing/context, but do not change install/update logic by themselves.

#### Agent

- `mode` -> tag (defaults to `subagent` when absent)
- `model` -> provider prefix tag (text before `/`)

#### Command

- `agent` -> `agent:<value>` tag

#### Skill

- `license` -> `license:<value>` tag
- `compatibility` -> `<value>` tag
- `metadata` object -> `<key>:<value>` tags

#### Target tags

When `targets` is provided for agent/command/skill, `skillful` also appends `target:<id>` tags for visibility and debugging.

### Opaque/pass-through fields

Additional frontmatter keys are allowed and preserved as source content for downstream target tools, but `skillful` does not currently interpret them for UI state or filtering.

Examples include agent fields such as `tools`, `permission`, `temperature`, `top_p`, etc.

### UI display policy

The TUI intentionally shows normalized fields only:

- name
- description
- tags
- install/support state
- store path
- source label/id

It does not render arbitrary frontmatter/JSON metadata fields directly.

### Authoring guidance

- Use `description` on all item types for clear browsing UX.
- Use `targets` only when an item is truly target-specific.
- Prefer portable metadata first; add target-specific constraints only when necessary.
